Discus requires that the following software be installed.

  o  Python.  I use 1.5.2.  Let me know if your version works.
  o  Either the Python statvfs module (included by default in Debian) or the
       external stat program.  Stat 2.2 works for me.  The version currently
       included in the FreeBSD port (stat 1.3) does not.


To install Discus without the benefit of a Debian package (available at
http://www.futuresouth.com/~stormy/discus.shtml), type something like
the following as root:

cp discus /usr/local/bin
chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/discus
cp discusrc /etc
chmod a+r /etc/discusrc
gzip -9 discus.1
cp discus.1.gz /usr/local/man/man1
chmod a+r /usr/local/man/man1/discus.1.gz
