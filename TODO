Simple things I'm considering adding to Discus:

  o  Choose your own column labels.
  o  Compact option to squeeze in everything including device name.
  o  A Makefile for non-Debian users.
 

Complicated things I'm considering adding to Discus:

  o  Add du(1) functionality to combine both disk usage functions into
     one software package.
